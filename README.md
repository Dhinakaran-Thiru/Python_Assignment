question 1
*Read the number of student records (n) from the input.
*Create an empty dictionary to store student records.
*For each of the n student records, parse the name and marks, and store them in the dictionary.
*Read the query name (query_name) from the input.
*Retrieve the marks corresponding to query_name from the dictionary.
*Calculate the average of the marks.
*Print the average with two decimal places.
question 2
*Read the integer n from the input, representing the number of participants.
*Read the list of integers scores from the input.
*Convert the input string of scores into a list of integers.
*Remove duplicates from the list of scores.
*Sort the list of unique scores in descending order.
*Print the second element in the sorted list, which represents the runner-up score.
question 3
*Convert the input string s into a list of characters.
*Update the character at the specified position in the list with the new character.
*Join the list of characters back into a string using the join() method.
*Return the modified string.
question 4
*Split the input string s into substrings of length k.
*For each substring:
*Create a new string by removing subsequent occurrences of non-distinct characters.
*Print the new string on a new line.
question 5
*Iterate from 1 to number.
*For each number:
*Convert it to decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary representations.
*Pad each representation with leading zeros.
*Print the formatted values on a single line, separated by spaces.
question 7
*Read the month, day, and year from the input.
*Extract the month, day, and year from the input.
*Use calendar.weekday() to find the day of the week.
*Convert the integer returned by calendar.weekday() into the corresponding day name.
*Print the day name in capital letters.
question 8
*import namedtuple from collections.
*Read the total number of students n.
*Read the column names and split them into a list.
*Define a namedtuple called Student with the column names.
*Use list comprehension to create a list of namedtuples, each representing a student, by reading the input and splitting it into respective fields.
*Calculate the sum of marks using a generator expression and compute the average by dividing it by n.
*Print the average marks formatted to 2 decimal places.
